Sound Prediction Inc. is a digitial health company headquartered in Columbus OH, but operating virtually in the continental United States.
We work closely with our non-profit partners, including [Mederrata Research](https://www.mederrata.com) to provide value to healthcare stakeholders.


## History

We formed in 2018, initially as Mederrata Inc., with a focus on using informatics for reducing medical error. Since then, we have broadened our scope of projects.
In 2019 we, as Mederrata Inc., won entry into the CMS AI Health Innovations challenge. At the time we were a loose collective of part time contributors who mainly had day-jobs at the National Institutes of Health.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, we began to productize our work that we performed both before and during the AI Challenge, building out data product pipelines and user interfaces in support of our modeling efforts.
